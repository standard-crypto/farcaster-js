## Setup

## Setup

Install the library:

```bash
npm install @standard-crypto/farcaster-js-cli
```

## Creating a developer managed signer

```
$ farcaster-js-cli create-signer
There are 2 options for creating a signer.

Developer Managed:
- A signer is generated by interacting with the KeyGateway Contract on Optimism (0x00000000fc56947c7e7183f8ca4b62398caadf0b).
- You must have a small amount of funds (~0.001) in your account's custody address on Optimism.
- You will need to provide the mnemonic for your account
- This signer can be used anywhere (except with Neynar).

Neynar Managed:
- Neynar creates a signer using your developer mnemonic.
- Approval is done through the Warpcast App by any user.
- Payment is required in the app using Warps or a $0.99 in-app purchase.
- A Neynar API Key is necessary.
- This signer is exclusive to Neynar APIs.

Which type of signer will you be creating?
 (Use arrow keys)
❯ developer
  neynar
? Enter your mnemonic: your mnemonic goes here
Transaction written to OP Mainnet. Check txn status at https://optimistic.etherscan.io/tx/<txn hash>
Transaction Confirmed! Your signer is ready to use.
